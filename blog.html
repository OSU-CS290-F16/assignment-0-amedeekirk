		<h1>ASSIGNMENT 1 RECAP</h1>
		<h3>09-26-16</h3>
		<br>
		Honestly the hardest part of this assignment was learning git/github. I do not have much experience with either, so pulling/committing/etc is a bit of a new experience. Fortunately the good ol' google has got my back for most of it. I am getting it down fairly well at this point, but I may require a bit more googling in the future before I fully commit it to memory. My HTML, while (obviously) not the prettiest, is functional. I probably should look into better styling practices before too long. I also do look forward to evolving this page with the other languages to make it look even better!

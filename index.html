		<h3>Name:</h3>
		<ul>Joseph Kirkpatrick, I go by my middle name Amedee however  (Am-uh-d)</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Major/Year of study:</h3>
		<ul>Computer Science major, this is my third year in college and first year at OSU</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Web Development Skills:</h3> 
		<ul>Solid 4. I am <i>very</i> comfortable with HTML, but I have little experience with CSS/Javascript/Node.js. I have data structures knowledge in C, but that's the extent of data storage that I know.</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Hopes for class:</h3> 
		<ul>Of course, I would love to greatly further my web development skills, especially front end. I am very lacking in front end knowledge I feel. As well, I would like to take away at least some "macro" concepts that I can apply to other areas of computer science to increase my comfort with coding in general.</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Signed up for Piazza:</h3>
		<ul>Yes, I have yet to participate, however. Soon though!</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Interesting fact/Unique Experience:</h3>
		<ul>Honestly, transferring to OSU is pretty close to the top of unique experiences I've had. I come from a community college (in my hometown) that isn't even a fraction of the size of this campus, so moving here is almost culture shock. As well, this is the first time moving away by myself, which is also very much different from my previous norm. For a interesting fact, I love shiba inus. You can expect to find many of them in my projects.</ul>

		<h3>Photo:</h3>
		<ul>I apologize, I don't have many photos of me readily available. Hopefully this one works:</ul>
